External Correspondence Management Automation (ECMA) is a system that digitally handles all official communications between an organization and outside parties — automatically, securely, and traceably.

“External correspondence” means communication with:

Citizens / customers

Other government institutions

Vendors & partners

NGOs, banks, auditors, etc.

Instead of paper letters, emails, and manual follow-ups, the system manages everything end-to-end.

🔄 What problems does it solve?

Before automation:

Letters get lost

No tracking or accountability

Slow approvals

Manual filing

No audit trail

Hard to report or search

After automation:

 Centralized inbox

 Easy tracking & search

 Faster response time

 Full audit trail

 Reports & dashboards

 Better security & compliance

 Classification & Routing
